# Statistics-Analysis

This project simulates one-dimensional random walks using Python and analyzes how changing movement probability affects the final position distribution. Multiple random walks are generated for three probability cases: unbiased (0.5), downward-biased (>0.5), and upward-biased (<0.5). The final positions are analyzed using mean, variance, and standard deviation, and visualized with line plots and box-and-whisker plots. The results demonstrate how probability bias shifts the distribution and how randomness behaves in unbiased stochastic processes.
